I successfully created my own linked list header file. This is going to be the data structure that my blockchain class
will take advantage of.

Also, I think I'm going to apply my blockchain to fundraising for video games. My blockchain tech can be used to verify
ownership of digital items purchased through the platform.

Implemented more functions for the blockchain class. And also looked into making my project decentralized with sockets.
So the idea is that I'd host a server whose only purpose is to allow clients to communicate with each other. The server
does not have authority over the canonical state of the blockchain. So I am reviewing sockets in C++ since the last time
I played with them was about a year ago when I made a reverse shell program in C++ and once it worked I forgot about how
to implement sockets. Added functions for adding blocks to the blockchain, mining blocks, validating the chain.

I guess the way server-client interactions will work is that everytime we boot up a client or a client modifies the
chain, we then request to look at the server's copy of the chain. If the client's copy of the chain is validated by
at least a certain amount of peers, then the server rewrites its copy of the blockchain and distributes the changes
to the clients. Also every time we boot up a client we will have to check if the server has more blocks than the client.
If so, then the client must retrieve the server's blockchain and rewrite its own.

Looks like there are no issues at all with the leading zeros!
